      <h3>Czech Republic</h3>
      <p>It is not a large country but has a rich and eventful history. Czechs, Germans, Slovaks, Italian stonemasons
        and stucco workers, French tradesmen and deserters from Napoleonâ€™s army have lived and worked here, all
        influencing one another. For centuries they jointly cultivated their land, creating works that grace this small
        country with hundreds of ancient castles, monasteries and stately mansions, and entire towns that give the
        impression of being comprehensive artefacts. The Czech Republic contains a vast number of architectural
        treasures and has beautiful forests and mountains to match.</p>
      <h3>Hungary</h3>
      <p>It is an EU member state featuring a gorgeous capital city, Budapest, and the largest lake in Central Europe,
        Balaton. Hungary offers many diverse destinations: relatively low mountains in the north-west, the Great Plain
        in the east, lakes and rivers of all sorts, and many beautiful small villages and hidden gems of cities. Top
        this off with Hungary's great accessibility in the middle of Europe, a vivid culture and economy, and you get a
        destination absolutely worth visiting if you're in the region</p>
      <h3>Romania</h3>
      <p>It is a country on the western shores of the Black Sea; except for Dobruja, it is north of the Balkan Peninsula.
        It is a country of great natural beauty and diversity and a rich cultural heritage, including a variety of
        ethnic, linguistic, and confessional groups. Romania enchants visitors with its scenic mountain landscapes and
        unspoilt rural areas, but also with its historic cities and busy capital. It has seen significant development
        and is one of the most recent members of the European Union. Still, it may surprise some of its visitors who are
        used to western Europe. It has six cultural and one natural UNESCO world heritage sites.</p>
